# Cell culture calculator

Researchers use cell calculators in order to plan their experiments.
Traditionally, they use excel spreadsheets, but the UI is not necessarily user friendly.
It's also difficult to understand.

The idea with this cell culture calculator is to give the researcher a 'single finger experience' (think Tinder, Reddit, etc.) to input the values and select the options they need to model and the app performs the calculations and shows its process in order to facilitate the validation of the results.
